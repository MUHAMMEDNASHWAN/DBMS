As of late, India has seen an enormous improvement in assortment of blood. In spite of such development, we face a
deficiency of almost 1.95 million units. We intend to make a productive data set framework to check the current holes in the
Blood banking frameworks and guarantee insignificant wastage of blood units. We have made a blood donation center administration information base utilizing Microsoft SQL server. Bungles at the hour of association of blood or blood parts have come about in
serious setbacks. We have made a framework that mitigates such disparities[1]. Rajya Sabha was educated by the Union
legislature of India that 63 areas didn't have blood donation centers. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Bihar,
Meghalaya and Nagaland are the states that face such issues.
