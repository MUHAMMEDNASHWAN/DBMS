\section{Experimental Analysis}
In this region, we will present the highlights and consequences of the plan to represent the execution of the
submitted data set framework. We additionally deciphered the meaning of various boundaries and corresponded them with
existing strategies.
\subsection{Blood bank systems and governing institutions of other countries}
\begin{itemize}
    \item UNITED KINGDOM:
    The UK has four transcendent public blood administration associations. In 1999, the UK blood administrations discussion was
established and was attending to the decentralization of government in the UK. It incorporates leader chiefs and
clinical chiefs for the four consortiums[8]. For safe blood stockpiling and blood bonding, JPAC has laid out
numerous rules like details for uniform naming of blood and human tissue items and different norm
conventions for electronic information trade inside UK blood bonding administrations
\item USA:
The UK has four extraordinary public blood organization affiliations. In 1999, the UK blood organizations conversation was
laid out and was taking care of the decentralization of government in the UK. It joins pioneer bosses and
clinical bosses for the four consortiums[8]. For safe blood amassing and blood holding, JPAC has spread out
various guidelines like subtleties for uniform naming of blood and human tissue things and different standard
shows for electronic data exchange inside UK blood holding organizations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Relational Algebra and sample queries}
The data set contains north of 4000 information passages which are made in a randomized way. It is made utilizing great
interlinked relations. Therefore we can decrease the hunt time as well as wiping out information overt repetitiveness. This makes
the data set more effective and lessens slack. We have made the framework utilizing SQL. Utilizing SQL based framework is
exceptionally simple. In this way continuously, the Pathology experts and phlebotomist can without much of a stretch acquire any data
from the data set and can plan the inquiries in the event that a few new inquiries emerge from end clients.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Select donor who did not donate in any camp (Donated directly at a hospital).
    
\item Relational algebra
∏donor_name ( σcamp_id (donar_info) - σcamp_id (Camp_info))

\item Sql query:
Select donor_name
From donar_info
Except
Select donor_name
From Camp_info;.

\item Name of all organizers who have organized in Ahmedabad

\item Relational algebra
∏organization_name(σcity=Ahmedabad”(camp_info)

\item Sql query:
Select organization_name
From camp_info


\end{itemize}
Where city=”Ahmedabad”;
