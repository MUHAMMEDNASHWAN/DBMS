\section{ Future Scope and Conclusion}
At present we have planned an effectively interlinked Database Management System. In future a GUI based
application can be made that associates the clients with the Various blood donation centers in the city and get data about
accessibility of kinds of blood accessible as well as data about givers if there should be an occurrence of crisis. This application can
be introduced in ambulances to save time. Ambulances can take patients straightforwardly to emergency clinics with their blood
type. With the assistance of this application emergency clinics will get notices before the expiry date of blood units as well as
notices of test dates and results to the blood donation center laborers. An application for givers can be assembled where they
will get SMS ready when they become qualified to give blood alongside data in regards to different blood gift
camps as well as building a mindful local area.
