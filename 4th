\section{Proposed Approach}
The proposed framework attempts to assist with blooding bank managers to support requests and different blood beneficiaries,
whether they are individual benefactors or clinics, with higher adequacy and weaken wastage. This approach attempts to
actually overcome any issues between blood donation centers, givers and beneficiaries by making powerful data sets and applications for all the three and further separating the information bases to diminish the possibilities of the irregularity of the information and
thus expanding the productivity of the framework.
The relational diagram of the proposed method is illustrated in the following:
